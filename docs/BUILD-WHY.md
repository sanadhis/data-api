## Why Maven
I don't like gradle (prefer using maven)

## Why Maven Wrapper (mvnw)
In effort to make maven version consistent when cloned to different environment. Furthermore, to avoid hassle in installing maven.

## Why Makefile
I don't want to remember syntax, especially when moving from one stack to another. This way,
I can use generic terms: `run`, `build`, `test`, `quality`, `package`, etc.
