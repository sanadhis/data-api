## Why Spring
In these recent years, I have been working on Spring Boot, MVC, Webflux, Cloud, etc.

## Why DTO
To enable automatic serialization and deserialization for incoming json payload and outgoing json response.

## Why Interface for @Service
Interface is used to oblige business logic and contract on @Service-annotated classes.

## Why JPA
To simplify boilerplate of code and query over database CRUD operation.

## Why Enum
I prefer to use Enum for helper classes (i.e. classes containing static method only) in order to:
- Avoid empty constructor
- Ensure singleton (i.e. no need to create object)

## Why Lombok
Despite there is a debate over lombok, I do not mind using it to reduce boilerplate code.
